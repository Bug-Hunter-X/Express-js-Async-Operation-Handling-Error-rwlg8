# Express.js Async Operation Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: incorrectly handling asynchronous operations as if they were synchronous.  The `bug.js` file contains code that fails to properly handle the asynchronous nature of fetching user data, leading to potential errors and incorrect responses. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version demonstrating the correct use of promises or async/await.
